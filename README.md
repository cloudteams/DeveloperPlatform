## About CloudTeams Team Platform

The CloudTeams team platform is implemented as an extension to BSCW (http://www.bscw.de/start/en/), which is the underlying document management and collaboration platform.

The CloudTeams team platform supports the workflow of the CloudTeams methodology for teams for managing software projects, collaborating in software teams, and running campaigns with customers. Moreover it provides interfaces that enable the customer platform and the persona builder to request project resources from and to deliver customer feedback to the team platform. By connecting to software development, testing and deployment tools it seamlessly integrates environments that software projects use in their software development process.

We offer you two options to evaluate the team platform at no cost:
  - Public CloudTeams platform, the free-trial service (requires only 2 minutes to set up and run).
  - Installation and test on an in-house server and then enjoy a free 90-day trial licence.
