## About CloudTeams Developer Platform

The CloudTeams developer platform supports the workflow of the CloudTeams methodology for teams. It  offers advanced and leightweight tools for managing software projects, collaborating in software teams, and running campaigns with customers. Moreover it integrates the persona builder, requirements builder, and the business model canvas tool implemented in the ideation platform (https://github.com/cloudteams/IdeationPlatform). By connecting software projects to third-party software development, testing and deployment tools (https://github.com/cloudteams/DeveloperServices) it seamlessly integrates environments that software projects use in their software development process.

The CloudTeams developer platform is implemented as an extension to the proprietary groupware system BSCW (http://www.bscw.de/start/en/), which is the underlying document management and collaboration platform.

We offer you two options to evaluate the developer platform at no cost:
  - Public CloudTeams platform, the free-trial service (requires only 2 minutes to set up and run).
  - Installation and test on an in-house server and then enjoy a free 90-day trial licence.
